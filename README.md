# Kantan-Ji: The Kanji Simplifier
This program aims to aid new Japanese learners with quick and easy ways to turn Kanji into Kana to be able to be read and understood.

From simply activating the program, and either hitting the capture button or a macro, you can simply drag over Japanese text on your screen, and get a simplified version of it to easily read.

## Installation:

I don't have this in a state to where I want to bundle it all in an executable just yet, so you'll have to do the following:

1. With a Python installation on your device, change directory to the folder of the install, and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. From there, you'll have all of the required packades for actually running the program, which you can do with the line:

python main.py

3. Now, you're ready to simplify some kanji!

## Flashcard Spreasheet -> Anki

The way I have the spreadsheet set up, the original kanji is in the first column 
and the second column is the simplified kana. 

With that, it's pretty easy to set up inside of Anki itself.

If you don't know how to do that, this video is a good guide
