# Kantan-Ji: The Kanji Simplifier
This program aims to aid new Japanese learners with quick and easy ways to turn Kanji into Kana to be able to be read and understood.

From simply activating the program, and either hitting the capture button or a macro, you can simply drag over Japanese text on your screen, and get a simplified version of it to easily read.
